# Problem 1:
A 3D gel contained live cells in it and using microscopy we took a Z-stack of 25 2D
images of the gel. Segment the cells, and then find a way to calculate the total number of the 
cells. In addition, find the volume and center of each cell in the 3D Z-stack.

A. Explain how you would calculate the number of cells, volumes, and centers? (Note: If you 
have multiple answers in mind, break them apart and explain each one separately.) Explain 
each solution/algorithm in detail.

B. Implement your answer using any programming language you want and save the resulting 
images

# Problem 2: 
Use the tiny folder from your lab 4 and load the images. Implement PCA based on 
what you learned in class to change the features (your pixel values) to meaningful ones. Place 
the eigenvectors into a matrix called P and then project each image onto the new system. Next
design a model using the new values of your data to classify the images.

A. How would you create your model to classify the objects? (Note: If you have multiple 
answers in mind, break them apart and explain each one separately.) Explain each 
solution/algorithm in detail.

B. Implement your answer using any programming language you want and save the resulting 
accuracy rate.
Note: Please use K-fold cross validation after you are done with PCA. (You can use any value 
for the number of the folds that you want)

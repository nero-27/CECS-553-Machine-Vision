# Machine-Vision-Lab-3
In this lab, assume the built-in ‘edge’ and ‘imfilter’ functions are not available to detect edges. Define 
the kernel you want to use and then write a code to perform a convolution with your image.  
1. Read “balloons.jpg” image. Find the boundary (not the patterns inside) of the air balloons.  
2. Count the total number of the balloons.  
3. Plot the resulting image from step 1, and as a title of your image, write the total number of the 
balloons you found in step 2. (No hard coding please) and then save the resulting image as a png.  
4. Choose a random air balloon in your binary image, change the pixels inside to white. Explain how 
you did that.  
5. Plot the result and then save the resulting image as a png.  
6. Move the balloon 20 pixels in any direction of 45-degree angle. Explain how you did that.  
7. Plot the result and then save the resulting image as a png.  
8. Upload your code (.m/.py files) and one pdf file that contains your code, your answers to questions,
and the resulting images.

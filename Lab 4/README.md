# Machine-Vision-Lab-4
In this lab we work on implementing k-NN algorithm and choosing the best value for k using cross fold 
validation technique.  
1. Read the tiny images located in tiny folder.  
2. Create labels for the image using the labels.txt file.  
3. Create 10 folds to do a cross validation.   
4. Leave one-fold aside for testing and the remaining 9 folds for training and validation. Explain how 
you did that.  
5. In your 9 folds calculate the average accuracy rate for each value of k (k = 1 to 15) in your k-NN.  
6. Plot a bar plot of all average accuracy rates using different k values and save it as png.  
7. Calculate the accuracy rate of your designed k-NN using the best selected k on the testing dataset 
from step four.  
8. Upload your code (.m/.py files) and one pdf file that contains your code, your answers to questions,
and the resulting images.

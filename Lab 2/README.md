# Machine-Vision-Lab-2
✓ Thresholding function: “im2bw”  
✓ Removing objects (connected components) with fewer than some fixed pixels: “bwareaopen”  
✓ Labeling connected components: “bwlabeln”  

Choose one of these functions and implement it yourself.   
(Note: if you are using python, and do not understand them, simply google e.g. “im2bw in MATLAB” and 
read the instructions of these functions. You then can implement them in python.)  
1. Segment the given rocks in “colorful rocks 2.jpg” image  
2. Plot the result and then save the resulting image as png.  
3. Count the total number of the gray rocks in the image and print the result.  
4. Calculate the area of each gray rock and save the result in a file. Explain how you did that.  
5. Estimate the center of each gray rock and plot the image with red stars on the calculated centers.
Explain how you found the centers.  
6. Upload a pdf file of your code, your answers to question 4 and 5, and the resulting images.  
Extra Credit: Instead of implementing only one, implement two or more of the mentioned functions above.
Please make sure to mention how many you have implemented in your pdf file.
